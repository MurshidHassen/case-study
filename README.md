# Used three major frameworks for implementing the UI Test Automation
Namely: Cypress, Codecept and Cucumber Selenium
# 1- Cypress is working with just a yarn and yarn start
# 2- CodeceptJS requires JDK properly installed with yarn start
Cucumber Selenium is incomplete and would push the changes onces I have finalized.
